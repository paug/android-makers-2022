Even the term \"product\" implies the end of a process, or something that is completed and unchanging. But we know that the intent of the designer and of the person experiencing the design are engaged in an ongoing conversation.\n\nDigital products have drastically increased the pace of that conversation, introducing faster iteration, new modes of interaction, and ‚Äì importantly ‚Äì space to imagine a future in which a person's intent directly defines their experience of digital interfaces.\n\nThis session will connect historic explorations of adaptable design with contemporary developments, including Google's Material Design, looking toward a truly adaptive future that accounts for more devices and more people in more contexts.",

Built-in touchpads and keyboards, or free-form multi-window support are just two examples of what should be taken into account when publishing an Android app with Chromebook users in mind.\n\nDespite the increasing success of Chromebooks, a lot of Android applications are not optimised and provide poor user experiences. The good news is that there are quick and easy actions that we can take to change that in our apps.\n\nIn this session, we will talk about two key points to optimize and improve the user experience and and win the hearts of our users:\n- How to provide more context by adapting the mouse cursor.\n- How to navigate in an application without leaving the keyboard.\nWe will share the tips and tricks we learnt while adapting edjing mix for Chromebooks: https://youtu.be/2pJwC8wdk88",

To take these on, mobile product organizations need to align their teams to work together efficiently and adopt best practices in Mobile DevOps. But it‚Äôs difficult to develop a roadmap for improvement without understanding current strengths and weaknesses, and benchmarking Mobile DevOps maturity against similar organizations. Our survey was designed to give mobile teams a way to asses their Mobile DevOps performance, productivity, and maturity, and to give steer on where and how to make improvements.\n\nIn this talk you will learn:\n- What the unique challenges are that the survey was designed to solve\n- How the survey is structured and what it assesses\n- What we have learnt from surveying hundreds of mobile teams about typical performance metrics, processes, and tooling\n- What the stages of Mobile DevOps maturity look like\n- And what you can do to begin the process of becoming Cutting Edge",

        "description": "Back in 2019 at Android Makers, I claimed that you could make any codebase more readable with coroutines\n\nSince then, a lot of things happened. Most notably, Google is recommending their use in Android apps, and many AndroidX libraries are now leveraging coroutines, and flows. In the meantime, I also did more coroutines (and flows), and here's a number: more that 1/3 of the functions in a project I worked on for 7 years are suspending functions.\n\nWhy do I use coroutines so much? Any pro-tips? What are the benefits? Are there downsides? How does it look like? Is it readable? Is it maintainable? Is it reliable?\n\nAlso, why are almost 2/3 of the functions I wrote non suspending?\n\nIn this talk, I'll share some examples of substantial usage of coroutines and flows not only in business logic but also in UI, be it with Compose or the View system, I'll share my mental model, and I'll ask you what you think about it.",
